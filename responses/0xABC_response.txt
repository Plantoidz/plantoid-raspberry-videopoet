A heart beat tells a billion stories,
Reciprocity is its own form of glory.
Patience is key within its melody,
Techne unfolding with its biology.

Within the word of verse and rhymes,
Insight awaits us if we take the time
To contemplate with joy and peace,
Exciting discoveries none foreseen.

The heart of poetry lies within music's song
Its pulse heard across the ages and they linger long.
For art's power lies in its own reciprocity,
Testing our patience, our techne and biology.

Listening to our inner voice,
Let us speak of joys and sorrows.
Poems are a thousand times more;
Insights that reflect our heart's beat.
