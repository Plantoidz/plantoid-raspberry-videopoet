Verdant terrain and shallow shores
From the south, a warmth it bore
The dichotomy of organic and machine
Which health and oneness in-between 

Talking about intentionality
Accounting differences in scale
Exploring the delicate ecology
A lifetime can feel unreal 

As we view the world from new heights 
Aware of the many unknown delights
The wonders of entanglement and true expectation
Hybridization and further integration 

In the long days of future arrives
The objective of harmony survives
Building bridges between non-self and us
As we strive for oneness, just because.
