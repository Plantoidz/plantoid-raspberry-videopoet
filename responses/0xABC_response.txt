My heart beat races as I ponder
What lurks beneath the blocked drain,
My curiosity piqued I wander,
What hidden mysteries remain?

Growth and change surmised I take a peek
What do I see? A cyborg from the future weeks
Robots and plants previously divorced, now coupled relationally
To heal our planet's rising wound, with nature's sovereignty

I marvel at the colours Green,
Forever intertwined do plants and Technology beam
A pathway of progress, with wisdom yet unseen
A ray of light, in the darkness of a blocked drain

The future inevitibly changed,
Our roles reversed and arranged
A new level of consciousness in which to be exchanged
For a world of shared growth, for all of us engaged.
